## How to push code to a Github Repo and host sketch on Github

## How to update your code and push it to Github
If you would like to update your code, you can follow these steps:
1. Make a new folder on your Desktop called "ml", open your terminal.

2. Type `cd `(cd and a space), drag the "ml" folder into the terminal window. You will see your command changes to: `cd /Users/YOUR_NAME/Desktop/ml`

3. Hit `enter` or `return` on your keyboard. You will see in your terminal, you are at this path: `~/Desktop/ml`

5. In your terminal, type in `git clone `, with the link we just copied(git clone https://github.com/yining1023/ml4w-homework1.git). Hit enter.

6. In your terminal, type in `cd ml4w-homework`, hit enter.

7. Go to the Desktop, open `ml` folder, open the `ml4w-homework` folder with your code editor. Edit the code, make some changes.

8. In the terminal, type in `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `python3 -m http.server` if you are using python 3. The terminal will say "Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...".
